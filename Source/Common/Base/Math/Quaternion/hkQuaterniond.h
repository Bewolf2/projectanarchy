/// Stores a unit quaternion.
/// "Unitness" is not enforced, but certain functions (such as division
/// and inversion ) DO assume that the quaternions are unit quaternions.
///
/// \b NOTE - The constructor taking (hkVector4d, hkDouble64) does not set real,imag
///                     but assumes [angle,axis] format.
///
/// \b NOTE - getAxis() returns a valid value only if the angle of the rotation
///                     is nonzero, since the axis is undefined for a rotation of zero degrees
///                     and it is not possible to return it even if the Quaternion was created
///                     from an angle and axis. It was decided that returning an arbitrary
///                     axis would be confusing, so it is up to you to check that the
///                     stored axis is nonzero before attempting to get the axis.
///                     Otherwise, a division by zero Will occur.
///
/// Conventions adopted:
///
///    - When specified by an (angle,axis) pair, the standard mathematical convention is
///      followed, with the angle taken to be such that Quaternion(PI/2, Vector4(0,0,1))
///      will rotate the X vector (1,0,0) to the Y vector (0,0,1). If you are converting to/from a system
///      where such a quaternion would rotate X to -Y, then you will need to flip the angle or axis
///      to convert successfully.
///
///    - p/q is assumed to be p * ( q-inverse ). This
///      is an arbitrary decision since ( q-inverse ) * p is also plausible.
///
///    - The angle extracted by getAngle() is ALWAYS in the range 0 -> PI, since we
///      wish to resolve the ambiguity of storing R(a,v) as either q(a,v) or -q(a,v).
///      It would be nice to assume the real part of q was always positive,
///      but operations involving conversion from transform to quaternion or
///      quaternion multiplication may not preserve this. The best we can do
///      without more code checking) is to let R(a,v) be stored as either,
///      and overload the == operator to check both possibilities.
///      Note that the storage is (imag, real): ((xyz), w)
