/// BETA - A memory snapshot which shows all levels of hierarchical allocations.
///
/// A memory snapshot can be obtained by a supported memory system by using the
/// hkMemorySystem::getMemorySnapshot() call. The memory system is the only entity
/// that knows exactly how the allocator hierarchy being used is laid out, and it is
/// therefore its responsibility to fill the memory snapshot properly. Every allocation
/// contains the ID of the entity (provider) it comes from; a full snapshot should
/// always contain an allocation at every level in the allocator hierarchy for each
/// top-level allocation (down to the system allocator).
/// Assuming we have a plain allocator stack like the following one:
/// 
/// 1. System allocator
/// 2. Large block allocator
/// 3. Padded allocator
/// 4. Memory system
/// 
/// For every user allocation recorded in the memory system (level 4), we should 
/// have a corresponding allocation at level 3 (plus some overhead caused by the padding),
/// which should be contained in an allocation at level 2 (a large block also containing some
/// overhead eventually). And the large block should be obtained from the system allocator
/// itself (with unknown compiler- and OS-driven overhead).
/// Depending on the specific memory system, we might instead end up with an incomplete
/// allocation tree where, for instance, there is no level 3, 2 or 1 allocation containing
/// an allocation registered by the memory system. In this case we assume that at the
/// missing levels we have no overhead (they behave as simple pass-through allocators
/// for that specific allocation).
/// The memory snapshot doesn't need to be complete, but it should be as complete
/// as possible.
///
/// Generally, only allocations from the system heap should be reported; if a memory
/// system (or an allocator used by it) allocates space to the user from some static
/// buffer, those allocations should NOT be reported.
