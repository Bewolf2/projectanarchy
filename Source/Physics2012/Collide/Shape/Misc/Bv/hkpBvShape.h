	/// The idea of a hkpBvShape is to surround a complex shape or shape collection by
	/// a simple bounding volume shape. As long as the bounding volume shape does not collide
	/// we know that the complex shape can't collide.
	/// So, a hkpBvShape needs two hkpShape members, one of which is the child shape, the other
	/// of which describes the bounding volume used for the child shape.
	///
	/// For example, you could use an hkpBvShape to
	/// create a phantom with a spherical bounding volume. In that case, the child shape would be a hkpPhantomCallbackShape
	/// and the bounding volume shape would be a hkpSphereShape.
