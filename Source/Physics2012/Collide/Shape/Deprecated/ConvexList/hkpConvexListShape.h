/// A simple static list of hkpShapes. You can use this shape class to create compound bodies.
/// A list shape can hold a mix of different shape types, however the radius of all shapes must be
/// identical (see below) which may limit its use in some cases.
/// The convex list shape is very good for smaller objects, which are made of a few convex pieces.
/// You will get a very good CPU for this convex list, as long as the hkpConvexListShape is
/// only colliding with its convex hull. A typical example would be a car made of several parts.
/// If your object looks more like a spaceship, where other bodies may frequently be 'inside' the hull
/// you should consider using hkpListShape wrapped in a hkpMoppBvTreeShape.
/// N.B. In either case, there is still a potential for a performance impact hit with complex compound bodies, so
/// it is advisable to contact Havok support to discuss optimum representation.
/// Note: This implementation has some limitations:
///     - the number of child objects is restricted to 255
///     - the number of vertices of each child object is restricted to 255 (see user guide)
///     - per-childshape collision filtering is not possible (for either collisions or raycasts)
///     - The radius of all child objects must be equal. For this reason you cannot usually combine
///       hkpSphereShapes, hkpCapsuleShapes and hkpConvexVerticesShapes in hkpConvexListShapes.
///
/// Please see the user guide for more details on the hkpConvexListShape
