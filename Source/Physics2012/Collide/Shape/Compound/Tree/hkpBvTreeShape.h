	/// An hkpBvTreeShape adds bounding volume tree information to an hkpShapeCollection, such as an hkpMeshShape.
	/// This is an abstract base class. See hkpMoppBvTreeShape for an implementation.
	///
	/// What does the bounding volume tree do?
	///
	/// A bounding volume tree is useful in situations where you need to check for collisions between a moving object
	/// and a large static geometry, such as a landscape.
	///
	/// The shapes that make up the landscape are hierarchically grouped in
	/// a binary bounding volume tree.
	/// At every node in the tree there exists a bounding polytope, which encapsulates all
	/// of its children. The top-level bounding volume contains the entire landscape, while
	/// the nodes on the leaf levels encapsulate one geometric primitive, normally a
	/// triangle. The fit of this bounding volume can be perfect (as in some AABB trees), or can
	/// have an extra margin/tolerance built in (e.g. MOPP). For more information please see the
	/// section on Creating Shapes in the Collision Detection chapter of the Physics manual.
	///
	/// Instead of checking whether the moving object is colliding with each of the triangles in the landscape in turn,
	/// which would be extremely time-consuming, the bounding box of the moving object
	/// is checked against the bounding volume tree - first, whether it is intersecting with the top-level bounding volume, then with
	/// any of its child bounding volumes, and so on until the check reaches the leaf nodes. A list of any potentially colliding triangles
	/// is then passed to the narrowphase collision detection. You can think of
	/// the bounding volume tree as a filter to the narrowphase collision
	/// detection system.
