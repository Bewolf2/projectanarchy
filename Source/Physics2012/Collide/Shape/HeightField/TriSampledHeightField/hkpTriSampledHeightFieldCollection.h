	/// You can use this shape to wrap a hkSampledHeightFieldBase shape. To use this, you must also combine this shape
	/// with the hkpTriSampledHeightFieldBvTreeShape, i.e., create a hkpTriSampledHeightFieldBvTreeShape, passing
	/// this shape into its constructor. This shape provides an alternative implementation to the sampled heightfield,
	/// where a different collision algorithm is used, while maintaining the memory usage of the heightfield.
	/// Instead of the approximate collision detection algorithm used by the heightfield shape (where colliding objects
	/// are represented by sets of spheres), this shape converts the heightfield into triangles on the fly.
	/// Collision detection may be slower, but will be fully exact.
	/// Because the shapes pulled out during collision detection are actual hkTriangleShapes, they may need a radius
	/// (which would not be necessary if using the approximate collision detection algorithm).
	/// Ray casting is performed using the standard heightfield raycast implementation.
	/// N.B. Per-triangle filtering can be done by inheriting and implementing the method hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo( hkpShapeKey key )
	/// as required. The current implementation does not implement this method because the user can best decide where to store the filter info.
	/// NOTE: Linear casting is performed using a simple implementation where the AABB of the linear cast is queried against
	/// the heightfield, and all overlapping triangles are checked with a linear cast. WARNING: for long linear casts,
	/// (particularly those parallel to the heightfield surface) this can be very slow.
