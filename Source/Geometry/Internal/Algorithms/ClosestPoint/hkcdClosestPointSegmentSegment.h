	/// Computes the closest points pair between two line segments and as segment fractions t,u of the inputs.
	/// Each segment is given by its starting point and its direction.
	/// The closest point on the first line is A+tOut*dA and the closest point on the second line is B+uOut*dB.
	/// You can check if the closest point is an endpoint by comparing the t and u values against 0 and 1.

	/// Compute and return the closest points and distance between two segments.
	/// The return value contains is a mask indicating which endpoints, if any, of the line

	/// of the first segment respectively. Similarly MASK_Z and MASK_W correspond to the start and end
